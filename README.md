# IpInfoTest custom app for Hubleto

The app retrieves information about any IP address from api.techniknews.net with the possibility to store it in a
database.

## Preparation

1. I started by checking the composer.json whether it uses any packages I am familiar with. I was glad to find
   Illuminate/Database there.
2. I proceeded to create the podman container, which required me to install all required extensions into php:
   8.4.15-apache, as I have never used this version before.
3. Then I ran the `php hubleto init` and needed to get to tweak a little bit the urls in the ConfigEnv.php file to get
   the assets loaded in browser.
4. Followed by creating the custom app `php hubleto create app IpInfoTest`.
5. I needed to create a model for storing FavouriteIPs `php hubleto create model Hubleto\\App\\Custom\\IpInfoTest FavoriteIP`, but there was a problem because of re-declaring AppMenu 
   class in namespace by vendor/hubleto/erp/apps/Api/Extendibles/AppMenu.php. I have corrected it the dirty way, and it looks
   like everything works. *AI helped me to analyze the call stack of failed command.* 
6. The newly created model "FavoriteIp" will need to have columns reflecting the API's response JSON properties. 
   Autogenerated model User was pointing to bad namespace, so I corrected it as well.
7. All retrieved properties will be displayed in the Home view. I understand that it is the app's main view. 
8. An additional view is needed to display the list of saved IP addresses ` php hubleto create mvc Hubleto\\App\\Custom\\IpInfoTest FavoriteIP`.
